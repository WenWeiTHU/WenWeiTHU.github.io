## About Me

I am currently a PhD student (from fall, 2021) at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and a member of the [THUML](https://thuml.ai/), advised by Prof. [MingSheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/). 

My research interests cover Deep Learning and Machine Learning. I am currently working on deep learning applications for **Time Series Analysis** (i.e. Foundation Time Series Models, Large Time Series  Models, Multi-modal Time Series Models). The pursuit of my reasearch is to implement deep learning methodology in valuable real-world applications.

For more information, you may take a look at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dS9HVU8AAAAJ) and [GitHub](https://github.com/WenWeiTHU).
