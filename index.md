## About Me

I am currently a PhD student (from fall, 2021) at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and a member of the [THUML](https://thuml.ai/), advised by Prof. [MingSheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/). 

My research interests cover Deep Learning and Time Series Analysis. I am currently working on time series foundation models and MLSys for time series. In addition to pure research, I also dedicate myself to promoting research on valuable real-world applications. My research aims to contribute to the advancement of intelligent systems capable of handling massive and complicated temporal data across domains, including finance, healthcare, industry, and environment.
